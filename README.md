# MapReflectionAPI

This API helps developer with viewing images on maps. It supports Spigot 1.12 - 1.19.

## Dependencies:

- [BKCommonLib](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/bkcommonlib.39590/)

## Credits:

The source is based on [MapManager](https://github.com/InventivetalentDev/MapManager). It removes the PacketListenerAPI
dependency and uses NMS with submodules instead of reflection to make the code easier to edit.
